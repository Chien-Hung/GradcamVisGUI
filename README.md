# GradcamVisGUI
Visulization GUI for gradcam and gradcam++

![alt tag](./demo/GradcamVisGUI.png)

The visualized image of gradcam and gradcam++ is min-max scale to 0 ~ 255, so the strength is a **relative value** for each layers and channels. 
It only reflects the information that the selected layer or channel focus on which part in the original image.
